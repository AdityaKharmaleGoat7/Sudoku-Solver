#Sudoku Solver
This C++ program is a Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution for the given Sudoku puzzle. The program takes a 9x9 grid as input, where empty cells are represented by 0, and finds the solution by filling in the missing numbers such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

#How to Use
Replace the grid array in the code with your unsolved Sudoku puzzle. Ensure that the grid is a 9x9 array where empty cells are represented by 0.

Run the program, and it will solve the Sudoku puzzle and display the solved grid in the console.
